## Installation

To use this project, ensure that Matplotlib is installed. If not, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade matplotlib

Usage
Partie 1: Afficher un Graphe Non Orienté
To display an undirected graph, use the plot_undirected_graph function:

# Example usage
edges = [((0, 1), (1, 2)), ((0, 1), (1, 0)), ((1, 2), (1, 0)), ...]
node_labels = { (0, 1): 'A', (1, 2): 'B', ... }
plot_undirected_graph(edges, node_labels)

# Example usage
edges = [((0, 1), (1, 2)), ((0, 1), (1, 0)), ((1, 2), (1, 0)), ...]
node_labels = { (0, 1): 'A', (1, 2): 'B', ... }
plot_undirected_graph(edges, node_labels)

Partie 2: Adapter la Fonction pour Afficher un Graphe Orienté
To display a directed graph, use the plot_directed_graph function:

# Example usage
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4)]
plot_directed_graph(edges)

# Example usage
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (2, 4)]
plot_directed_graph(edges)

Partie 3: Créer une Animation pour le Parcours BFS
To create an animation for the BFS traversal, use the animate_bfs function:

# Example usage
edges = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ...]
animate_bfs(edges, start_node='A')
